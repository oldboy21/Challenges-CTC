Hey Vince, not sure what's wrong with these API endpoints but the train has left and we're not 100% operational. 
If this problem gets escalated we better look for another job! 
I've convinced the net admin to grant us access tcpdump and the test script to retrieve the application logs, please tell me what you think about the output! 

P.S. 
Why do people keep implementing custom patch to fix big issues like that? 
Keep me posted!
