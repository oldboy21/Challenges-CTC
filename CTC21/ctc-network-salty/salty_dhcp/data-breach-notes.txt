Hey Vin, 
Our security team contacted me saying that the gang was able to compromise all our IoT devices at once after having compromised this machine. There must 
be something running here which allowed them to take over the devices, the infrastructure team did not get back to me yet about this so please take a fast 
look and let me know what you think. The machine itself looks pretty clean and all the network connection have been resetted ...
